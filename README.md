# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Walmart-Python-Sql

## Business Overview
Walmart, as one of the world’s leading retail giants, faces an ongoing challenge to understand and respond effectively to customer needs and market trends. As a business that operates across various cities and branches, Walmart’s ability to manage inventory, optimize staffing, and refine marketing strategies is essential to maintain profitability and customer satisfaction.

This project aimed to empower Walmart with deeper insights into their sales data by analyzing transaction patterns, customer preferences, and revenue trends. Through exploratory data analysis approach using Python and SQL, the project’s goal is to provide Walmart with actionable information to enhance operational efficiency and make data-driven decisions.

## Project Overview
The company has access to a wealth of transactional data across its branches and cities but needed a streamlined approach to address critical business questions:

Which branches and product categories generate the highest revenue?
What payment methods do customers prefer, and how do preferences vary across locations?
When do stores experience peak shopping hours?
Which product categories show the highest and lowest profit margins?
Are there any branches with notable year-over-year revenue growth or decline?

Answering these questions would enable the company to concentrate on high-profit product lines, optimize inventory management, adjust staffing schedules effectively, and implement targeted, location-specific promotions.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the Walmart Sales Dataset from Kaggle, which includes transaction data across multiple branches, categories, and cities. Key characteristics of the data are the following:

Columns: Contains fields such as date, branch, city, category, payment_method, rating, and quantity_sold.
Timeframe: Covers daily transaction data for an extended period, enabling year-over-year analysis.
Characteristics: Contains ratings and transactional details that allow for customer sentiment analysis and sales pattern identification.
